# Scilab binary as an AppImage

This project aims to ship the Scilab binary from [www.scilab.org](https://www.scilab.org) as an [AppImage](https://appimage.org) for standalone usage.

The runner script shipped within the scilab tarball is generic enough to be re-used ; all the heavy lifting should be already done upstream and shared cross-distro.
